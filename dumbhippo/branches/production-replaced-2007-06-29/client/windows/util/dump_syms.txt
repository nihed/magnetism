dump_syms.exe is simply a prebuilt binary of the dump_syms tool from the
Google Airbag distribution. The reason for including it here is that
the necessary header files for building it aren't included in the
Express or Standard editions of Visual Studio, but only in the
"Enterprise Edition".

This binary is obtained from the Mozilla CVS tree:

  http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/airbag/tools/win32/

From the command line:

  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot cat mozilla/toolkit/airbag/tools/win32/dump_syms.exe > dump_syms.exe
