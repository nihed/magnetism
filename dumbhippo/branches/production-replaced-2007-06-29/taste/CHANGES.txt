1.0.1 (2006-01-08)
- Fixed a reasonably important bug that caused Recommneder implementations
  to not return the best recommendations in many cases. Thanks to
  pevm on sourceforge.net for the report.

1.0 (2005-12-16)
- The first non-beta release. Good.
- Added Recommender.recommender(..., ItemFilter),
  Recommender.estimatePreference()
- Corrected a couple problems with the web service -- should work as
  expected now
- Update to Axis 1.3
- Final updates and edits to documentation

0.9.5 (2005-12-08)
- Release candidate 2!
- Fixed bug in the ordering of recommended items from Recommenders
- RecommenderServlet now returns recommended items as
  "preference-value[tab]item-id"
- RecommenderServlet now supports a "debug" flag which dumps more item info
- Added getDataModel() to Recommender
- FileDataModel and AbstractJDBCModel now expose methods buildUser(),
  buildItem(), buildPreference(). This allows subclasses a "hook" by which
  they can instantiate their preferred implementations, making these
  DataModel implementations reusable. These classes are non-final now, as
  are GenericUser, GenericItem, GenericPreference
- Additional changes to refresh() methods to avoid potential problems
  when modules have a circular dependency and refresh each other
- Removed actual GroupLens data from distribution to comply with license
- Improved the demo application and its documentation

0.9 (2005-11-29)
- This should be considered a 1.0 release candidate
- Recommenders now return RecommendedItems, which include a preference
  value in addition to the Item itself
- More minor code refactoring
- New unit tests for Recommenders
- Updated some third-party tools to latest version (FindBugs, MySQLConnector)

0.8 (2005-09-11)
- Added a mechanism to create and deploy a web interface to Taste
  on top of a servlet container like Tomcat
  - Supports web services via Axis
  - Supports simpler HTTP GETs for recommendations too
- Rewrote the EJB support to match the new HTTP web interface
- Minor fixes and slight performance tweaks across the board

0.7.5 (2005-09-02)
- Minor changes to ItemCorrelation: now takes Item parameters
- More profiling and performance enhancements. In particular,
  GenericItemCorrelation lets you plug precomputed item similarities
  into GenericItemBasedRecommender to get a fast recommender system.

0.7 (2005-08-22)
- New! support for item-based recommender systems
- Significant renaming and refactoring to support that
- More unit tests, after Emma coverage reports showed some gaps

0.6.5 (2005-07-29)
- General code cleanup after updating to IntelliJ 5.0, including use of
  IntelliJ's @Nullable and @NotNull annotations
- Lots of performance profiling and lots of performance improvements --
  2-4x or more depending on your setup
- LoadTest JUnit test
- EJB can now find a Recommender implementation in JNDI

0.6 (2005-07-24)
- Added InverseUserFrequency transform
- Reimplemented the idea of "default preference". This is now encapsulated by
  implementations of the PreferenceInferrer interface, instead of User.
  Instances can be plugged into a Correlation, where they are now more
  properly used. So, we now have "default voting".
- Refreshable interface. Everything is "refreshable" now. Many classes
  pre-compute values that may become stale; callers can clear stale data in
  any component now by calling refresh() on a component (in particular,
  instances of Recommender).
- CachingRecommender uses more fine-grained locking for better performance
- New tests, updated documentation

0.5 (2005-07-11)
- Recommender/DataModel now have setPreference() method for real-time updates
- Neighborhood implementations now take advantage of multiple processors
- Minor enhancements to JDBCModel; now named MySQLJDBCModel
- Improved MySQLJDBCModelTest -- now sets up the table/data
- Spruced up the documentation / web page

0.4 (2005-06-17)
- Rewrote JDBCDataModel to be much more reasonable about memory
  requirements -- no longer reads everything into memory.
- Fixed some obvious bugs in JDBCDataModel
- FileDataModel
- Tests for both DataModel implementations
- Logging

0.3 (2005-06-06)
- Added RecommenderEJB interface (tested on JBoss 4)
  Next version will likely see revisions to this interface
- Beginnings of a J2EE 1.4 web service interface
- Added CosineMeasureCorrelation
- User's Guide

0.2 (2005-05-26)
- Most javadoc is complete
- A few more tests, for Correlation implementations
- JDBCDataModel
- Miscellaneous tweaks and fixes, mostly to PearsonCorrelation

0.1 (2005-05-20)
- Initial release, including basic code, a few tests, and no documentation. 
  Code is in good shape -- what's there -- but interfaces will likely 
  change a lot.
