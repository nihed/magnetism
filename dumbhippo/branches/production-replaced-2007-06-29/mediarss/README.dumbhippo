This directory is an import of the Rome 'mediarss' module
(http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Javawsxml/MediaRSS), created
so we could fix some bugs we were hitting.

Upstream changes should be imported into the vendor branch
(svn+ssh://svn.mugshot.org/svn/mediarss/vendor/current), and
then merged into this directory.

The toplevel of the import is:

 subprojects/modules/mediarss/

Inside the CVS directory:

 pserver:<username>@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs/rome
