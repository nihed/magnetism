<h3>Mugshot Terms of Use Agreement<br>
May 25, 2006</h3>

<p>
<b>1.   Background.</b>
Mugshot is an online service that enables Users to share information and communicate with others.  The Services offered by Mugshot ("Mugshot," "us" or "we") include the Mugshot Website (the "Website"), the Mugshot web services, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Mugshot in connection with the Website (collectively, the "Services").
</p>
<p>
This Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the Services. By using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the Website) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered with Mugshot). The term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are only authorized to use the Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and to this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully and save it. If you do not agree with it, you should leave the Website and discontinue use of the Services immediately. If you wish to become a Member, communicate with other Members and make use of the Services, you must read this Agreement and indicate your acceptance at the end of this document before proceeding to the Registration process.  
</p>
<p>
This Agreement includes Mugshot's policy for acceptable use of the Services and Content (described below) posted on the Website, your rights, obligations and restrictions regarding your use of the Services and Mugshot's Privacy Policy. In order to participate in certain Services, you may be notified that you are required to download software or content and/or agree to additional terms and conditions. Unless otherwise provided by the additional terms and conditions applicable to the Services in which you choose to participate, those additional terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement. You may receive a copy of this Agreement by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:feedback@mugshot.org">feedback@mugshot.org</a>, Subject: Terms of Use Agreement.

<p>
Mugshot may modify this Agreement from time to time and such modification will be effective upon posting by Mugshot on the Website. You agree to be bound to any changes to this Agreement when you use the Services after any such modification is posted. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.
Please choose carefully the information you post on Mugshot and that you provide to other Users. Your Mugshot profile may not include the following items: telephone numbers, street addresses, and any photographs containing nudity, or obscene, lewd, excessively violent, harassing, sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable subject matter. Despite this prohibition, information provided by other Mugshot Members (for instance, in their profile) may contain inaccurate, inappropriate, offensive or sexually explicit material, products or services, and Mugshot assumes no responsibility or liability for this material. If you become aware of misuse of the Services by any person, please contact Mugshot. 
Mugshot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any posting (including email) by you, or to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, and without liability.
