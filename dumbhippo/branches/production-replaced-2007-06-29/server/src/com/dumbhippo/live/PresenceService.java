	/* NOTES: Concurrency and Thread Safety
	 * 
	 * Functions in this class can be accessed from a number of different threads:
	 *  - The application's own threads
	 *     - Read local and remote state
	 *     - Modify local state
	 *     - Add and remove listeners
	 *  - Application code running in the thread we use for notifications 
	 *     - Read local and remote state
	 *     - Modify local state (rare, but allowed)
	 *     - Add and remove listeners (rare, but allowed)
	 *  - Our thread for receiving JGroups events (ReceiveThread)
	 *     - Modify remote state
	 *     
	 * The amount of locking needed is reduced by several observations:
	 * 
	 *   - Remote state is modified only from a single thread
	 *   - Items are only added to the map of local location information, never removed.
	 *   - When reading state for an application, we generally just need a snapshot;
	 *     it doesn't even need to be a consistent snapshot - it's fine if the
	 *     returned information shows two users both present even if one left before
	 *     the other joined
	 *     
	 *  These observations allow us to use ConcurrentHashMap rather than full locks
	 *  in a couple of places, and also to synchronize only on individual locations
	 *  rather than globally. (More details in comments at the affected code portions)
	 *  
	 *  The general locking scheme we use is to use a single lock for all modifications
	 *  and reads to a particular LocationInfo (server/location) pair, and to lock
	 *  only as needed at a higher level. A couple of tricky points to watch out for:
	 *  
	 *   - When modifying a LocalLocationInfo we need to hold a lock over the
	 *     modification and queueing the message we send out to preserve ordering.
	 *   - Modifications to LocalLocationInfo.notifyGuids and LocalLocationInfo.listeners 
	 *     need to be protected  by the same lock to prevent race conditions when adding 
	 *     listeners.
	 *  
	 *  It would be possible to use read-write locks on LocationInfo to further improve
	 *  concurrency, but if lookups are taking enough time so that it matters, it might
	 *  make more sense to look at improving the data structures so that you don't
	 *  have to do separate lookups for each server and sum the results.
