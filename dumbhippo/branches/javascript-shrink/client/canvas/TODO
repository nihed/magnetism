List of possible future enhancements / likely directions, we are doing these "as needed"

- HippoCanvasContainer
 
  add HippoCanvasContainer interface, add set_parent/get_parent on canvas item that 
  gets/sets a container, move get_position and set_child_visible from box to container

- Avoid having to always align images

  image item should maybe default to center alignment instead of fill like most items do

- Allow composite items to be activated/prelighted

  e.g. in one place in mugshot we have a CLOSE link and then an X icon next to it; should be able 
  to make the box containing those two a composite button, where the whole thing prelights 
  as a whole, and you can connect to "activated" on the whole thing.

  One way to do this would be to make HippoCanvasBox::clickable into a settable 
  property; and if a box is clickable, do not forward click events to
  its children, instead just activate the parent. This doesn't address 
  prelighting the composite as a whole though.

- Naming of get_width_request / get_height_request

  With get_natural_width there, naming these get_min_width/get_min_height makes some 
  amount of sense. request is sort of gtk jargon.

  Or really, merging into something like:
    get_width_request(item, &minimum, &natural);
    get_height_request(item, for_width, &minimum, &natural);
  The merging makes it easier to implement in items, since the min/natural code is often
  related or the same. Note also the addition of natural height, something 
  we don't have right now.  

- Clean up cascading styles

  Right now affect_font_desc / affect_color / get_color are on HippoCanvasContext,
  they should probably all be on a separate interface (HippoStylist?) or something
  like that. Then HippoStyle would also implement this interface perhaps.

- Set class-default font and colors

  if you allow setting a box to "gray 11px" for example, then the CanvasLink items in there 
  will override the gray with blue, since links default to blue. So each item should 
  first use its own props, then its context's props, then its class props, then its
  parent class props.

  There's a little hack around this right now with HippoCanvasBoxClass::default_color

- The return value of button press event needs to be known by the
  parent in advance.

  If the parent is going to handle the click if the child doesn't, then it needs 
  to be able to display prelights and change the mouse cursor and so forth.
  
  One approach might be to generalize get_pointer to return some kind of 
  "what-this-item-handles-info" (and enforce it by not delivering events
  the item doesn't say it will handle)

  Or get_pointer and get_tooltip could be merged into a sort of "hover state"
  indicating info about the hover point.

  The "handles click" flag is probably per-mouse-button.

- To handle tooltips correctly, a widget or CanvasBox displaying a canvas item
  really needs a unique ID for a each different logical zone that's returned.
  Both the tooltip text and the for_area can change while the pointer is
  still inside the same logical element of the display.

  This could be done by having in a "hover state" the desired mouse pointer,
  tooltip text, tooltip area, and an "owner" made up of a pointer (usually 
  a canvas item pointer) and an integer id.

- Summarizing the last two ideas, an ugly version might be:

  struct {
    HippoCanvasPointer pointer;
    char *tooltip;
    HippoRectangle area;
    void *owner_id_pointer_part;
    int owner_id_int_part;
  } ButtonOneHandlerInfo;

  /* returns true if it handles */
  gboolean (* get_button_one_handling) (HippoCanvasItem *item,
                                        ButtonOneHandlingInfo *info_p);
