<p>
<b>1.   Background.</b>
Mugshot is an online service that enables Users to share information and communicate with others.  The Services offered by Mugshot ("Mugshot," "us" or "we") include the Mugshot Website (the "Website"), the Mugshot web services, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Mugshot in connection with the Website (collectively, the "Services").

<p>
This Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the Services.

The term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are only authorized to use the Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and to this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully and save it. If you do not agree with it, you should leave the Website and discontinue use of the Services immediately. If you wish to become a Member, communicate with other Members and make use of the Services, you must read this Agreement and indicate your acceptance at the end of this document before proceeding to the Registration process.
