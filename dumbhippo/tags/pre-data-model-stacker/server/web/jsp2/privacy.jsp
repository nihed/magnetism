<h3>
Mugshot Privacy Notice
</h3>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.redhat.com/legal/privacy_statement.html">Red Hat, Inc. Privacy Statement</a> (the "Red Hat Policy") describes how Red Hat treats personal information when you use our products and services, including information collected when you use Mugshot.  By accessing and using Mugshot, you are accepting the practices described in the Red Hat Policy, as well as the following privacy practices that are specific to Mugshot:
</p>

<p>
<b>
Information We Collect and How We Use It
</b>
</p>

<p>
When you create an account for Mugshot, we collect the information that you submit to us during the registration process, such as certain of the information listed in the Red Hat Policy and other profile data.  We use that information to verify your identity when you log in to Mugshot, to provide the Mugshot services, to customize advertising to you, and as otherwise described in the Red Hat Policy. Some of your Mugshot profile information may also be accessed and viewed by other Mugshot members. After logging in, you may review and update your profile information.  Changes you make to your profile information are effective immediately.  
</p>

<p>
As you use Mugshot, we may collect other information relating to you, such as the content of any messages you post and the activities you undertake as you use Mugshot, for example  the links you post and the music you listen to.  If you choose to install the Mugshot software on your local system, music that you listen to on your local system will automatically be listed in your profile information.  You may disable and re-enable this passive publishing of your music history at any time. As part of the Mugshot service we may provide this information to other users of Mugshot.  We may also use this information to tailor advertising to you and make recommendations to you about other music, websites and content you may like.  For example, if you often listen to a certain musical artist, we or an advertising partner with whom we share your personal information might display an advertisement alerting you to the release of a new CD by that artist. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, we also log non-personally identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser and platform type, from users of Mugshot.  This data is used to manage Mugshot, track usage, compile user demographics and improve the Mugshot services.
</p>

<p>
<b>
Information Posted By You
</b>
</p>

<p>
Any personal information you voluntarily provide in a Mugshot public space such as any comments, links to websites, music lists or other personal information may be accessed by other Mugshot members and can in turn be used by those people for whatever purposes they wish.  When you send information through Mugshot, your Mugshot account name and photo will be identified with that information. If you have marked other users of Mugshot as your friends or contacts, they will also have increased access to your personal information including your email address and third party account names, if you have provided them to Mugshot.  Information that is visible to your friends or contacts is identified as such in your account configuration page.  
</p>

<p>
<b>
Invitations
</b>
</p>

<p>
If you invite another person to join Mugshot, we use the name and email address you provide us to contact that person and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited by you to join Mugshot.  All invitees are given the option not to receive further invitations from Mugshot.
</p>

<p>
<b>
Sharing of Personal Information
</b>
</p>

<p>
We will only share your personal information with third parties as described herein and in the Red Hat Policy.
</p>

<p>
<b>
Use of Cookies
</b>
</p>

<p>
In addition to the use of cookies described in the Red Hat Policy, we or our advertising partners may set cookies on your computer that allow an advertising server to recognize your computer each time you are sent an online advertisement. In this way, advertising servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on.  This information allows an advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that will more likely be of interest to you.  Mugshot does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by advertising partners.
</p>

<p>
<b>
Security
</b>
</p>

<p>
Mugshot takes reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alternation, disclosure or destruction of personal information.  Mugshot member accounts are secured by member-created passwords.  From time to time passwords and other personal information may be transmitted to and from Mugshot without encryption.  For this reason you should use a unique password for your Mugshot account, and refrain from using your Mugshot password for other online services.
</p>

<p>
<b>
Disabling Your Account
</b>
</p>

<p>
You can disable your Mugshot account at any time.  If you do decide to disable your account, the personally identifiable information we have collected about you will no longer be used by us, and will not be accessible by other Mugshot users.  Information that you have posted to public areas of the site will remain visible, in addition to your account name.
