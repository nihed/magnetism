In order to create the Firefox component, we needed to use a small
number of private Firefox interfaces (basically, 
nsIScriptSecurityManager::CheckSameOrigin). 

To enable people to build the Firefox component with the packaged 
public SDK, instead of requiring them to build the Firefox sources
from scratch, we've included a small number of header files here. 

The headers here are extracted from builds of Firefox-1.5.0.4 and
Firefox-1.5.0.8; any source IDL files are included for completeness, 
but aren't used. (Not all IDL files included)
