This module contains integration points with web apps such as GMail or
Flickr or any others, allowing them to be first-class substitutes for
local desktop apps.

For example:
 
- .desktop files are needed to make it easy to add these apps as panel
  launchers.
- local executables are needed for mailto: or MIME handlers
- often some type of notification of new mail or calendar appointments
  comes in handy

This is all in one big tarball since it would just be annoying to have
a little tiny tarball for every web app. If anything in here gets
large and complex, we can split it out.
