The idea of this daemon is to have one daemon that exports info about
a desktop session on the local network.

This daemon uses Avahi, but individual desktop apps and services don't
have to; they just export properties via D-Bus which are then proxied
by the local export daemon onto the LAN.

The local export daemon will support one request to get a list of
everything the user's session has to offer to other users on the LAN.

Over time we can experiment with what info requires connecting to the
daemon, what info is in the TXT records, and so forth.

For now the basic idea is to reduce the complexity apps have to deal
with: from "understanding zeroconf" to a couple of simple method calls.
