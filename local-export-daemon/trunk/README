The idea of this daemon is to have one daemon that exports info about
a desktop session on the local network.

This daemon uses mDNS and/or link-local XMPP, but individual desktop
apps and services don't have to; they just export services via D-Bus
which are then proxied by the local export daemon onto the LAN.

The local export daemon will support one request to get a list of
everything the user's session has to offer to other users on the LAN.
The returned list of stuff can also contain so-called "metadata" for
each item.

This makes LAN traffic more efficient (each machine just queries for
and resolves this one service), and makes it easier to write apps with
local functionality. In theory anyway. We'll see.

According to http://www.zeroconf.org/Rendezvous/txtrecords.html TXT
records should be used as an optimization rather than a necessary
thing, perhaps this affects what we do here. We should be able to use
TXT records to optimize in some cases, perhaps. I'm not clear on the
performance issues.
