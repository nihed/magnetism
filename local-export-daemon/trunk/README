The idea of this daemon is to have one daemon that exports info about
a desktop session on the local network.

This daemon uses mDNS, but individual desktop apps and services don't
have to; they just export services via D-Bus which are then proxied by
the local export daemon onto the LAN.

The local export daemon will support one request to get a list of
everything the user's session has to offer to other users on the LAN.
The returned list of stuff can also contain so-called "metadata" for
each item.

This makes LAN traffic more efficient (each machine just queries for
and resolves this one service), and makes it easier to write apps with
local functionality. In theory anyway. We'll see.
